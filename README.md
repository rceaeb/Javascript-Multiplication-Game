<p>This is a multiplication site that allows users to practice multiplying numbers 1-12. When the user enters, they must choose which number they wish to multiply by and the amount of questions they want. They must fulfill these two criteria if they wish to start the game. When the user starts the set of problems, they will see a title, three buttons (restart, finish, and quit) and the problems themselves. Clicking the restart button will generate a new set of problems without changing the amount of problems or the number chosen. When the user clicks the finish button, a light-green color will indicate which problems they got right and a red color will indicate which problems they got wrong. When finished, a new button will pop up allowing the user to see a small table summary of their results. They can flip back and forth between this table screen and the original in-game screen. Lastly, when clicking the finish button, the user will go back to the original main menu they saw when they first went to the site.</p>
